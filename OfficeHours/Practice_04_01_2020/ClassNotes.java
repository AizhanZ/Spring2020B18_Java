2 ways creating object from string:
			1. String literal
						String str = "Cybertek";
			2. new keyword:
						String str2 = new String("Cybertek");
				str == str2 ==> false
String is immutable
			once the object is created  it won't  change
String is sequences of characters
			String str = "Cybertek123$# ";
			// index:     01234567...
			index number: starts from zero, cannot be negative

We cannot give negative numbers in Index, the smallest number is 0 - zero

Space is also considered as character and should have a number

length() do not pass anything in brackets because it returns the total numbers of characters

Index starts from 0
Length starts from 1

If I want to find out the max number of characters without counting
find out the last number of characters and subtract -1 from length ???????

cannot modify string object but can reassign

length() - if you want to give the ending index to the substring (means include)  ???
